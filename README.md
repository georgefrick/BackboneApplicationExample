BackboneApplicationExample
==========================

A JQuery tabbed Backbone application using routing.

George Frick

By extending Backbone.js Router to add, remove and manage an instance of JQuery UI Tabs; you can build a single page
web application without the mess. Organize your code into "modules", and launch the modules within tabs.

Each "module" can be developed independently; giving the application a real 'windowed' feel on a single page. The
application is focusing on kick starting applications and helping users learn backbone. From there you can use it as
an application skeleton; or just a fun example to refer back to.
